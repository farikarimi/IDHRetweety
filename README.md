# IDHRetweety

Retweety is a small Python script, which utilises the Tweepy library to retweet the hashtags "#75liberation" and "#75befreiung" 
on certain Twitter accounts.

If you want to set up your own retweety script, simply fill out the "access_credentials.py" with your Twitter dev tokens and alter the hashtag variable in app.py.
Then choose some Twitter handles to retweet from and write them into the "users.csv".
If you want to get notified via mail if there is a Twitter error alter the smtp config in app.py
Run the script and wait for the retweets.
